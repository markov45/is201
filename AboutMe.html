    <p>My Name is Nathan Johnson and I grew up in the Seattle Washington Area. When I was growing up I fell in Love with Photography. I started at the age of 8 with a point and shoot camera. When I was about 13 years old I had savved up enough money to buy myself a DSLR. I used it all the time and got some amaizng pcitures. When I was about 17 years old I upgraded my camera and joined a photogarphy class. I contunited ot love the craft and art of phtography. Although I don't go out to take photos as much as I used to I still have a tallent for taking photos.
